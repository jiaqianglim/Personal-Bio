Hello, I make stuff, I write reports, and I write code for making stuff and writing reports.

In a nutshell:
Data Wrangling, Machine Learning and one-off scripts: Python (Tensorflow/ FastAI)
Simple/Casual Web Stuff: Javascript (NodeJS + Express, maybe Total in the future)
Complex Web Stuff: C# (ASP.NET, Microservices, Repository-Service pattern etc)
